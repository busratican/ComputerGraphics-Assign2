CENG415 ASSIGNMENT2

In this assignment, the hard parts are (for me) lights, perspective camera and shading.
Firstly, I cannot do this parts. Then, I get the Dot products of ray and light.
In addition, I added new class and headers which are 
-shader.h(main or root class like object3d), 
-diffuseShader.h,
-diffuseShader.cpp, 
-normal.h,
-normal.cpp ,
-floatingpoint.h.
These classes helps to me to getting the normal image, adding lights and getting the shading.

In this assignment,I have fun a lot however it was very hard assignment.
I do my shape in scene12.txt. I romeved scene files name because when I gave the parameters, these names are very long
when you enter it. So I change and say for example scene1.txt,scene2.txt..etc.

My perspective camera was not work the last assignment. So I fixed it.

In images file, you can see the new outputs.

The commands are same as the first assignment. You can see the below:

Command for output image -> "-input scene12.txt -size 100 100 -output output.tga"
Command for normal image -> "-input scene12.txt -size 100 100 -normal normal.tga"
